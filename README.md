# squero

[![ci](https://github.com/alexboscolo954/squero/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/alexboscolo954/squero/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

An SRE Hub for Kubernetes that serves several clients at once. Each client is a **Contract**: its clusters, integrations, Slack channel and secrets, kept apart from every other client's.

- **Triage.** Alertmanager or Grafana sends an alert group (one notification holding one or more alerts). An agent investigates with read-only tools (pods, events, logs, rollout history, recent changes, Prometheus, runbooks, the clouds) and returns a structured Report: root cause, evidence, confidence and recommendations for the on-call engineer.
- **Resource optimizer.** The Hub reads each cluster's usage, sizes every container, prices it, and reports waste, cost by team, and Savings, checked against the cloud bill.
- **Changes wait for a human.** A fix is only ever a *Proposed action*, and it **does not run until a human approves it**. It is rejected automatically if nobody decides in time or the alert group resolves first.

Three parts, all from one image:

| Part | Where it runs | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Hub** | A machine you own (compose stack) | Takes alerts, runs the agent, stores everything in Postgres, talks to Slack, serves the web console and an MCP server |
| **Relay** (optional) | Inside a client's cluster | For a cluster the Hub can't reach: carries the Hub's reads and the cluster's alerts over an outbound websocket |
| **Actuator** (optional) | Inside a client's cluster | Applies the Sizings you approved, in place, and rolls one back if it hurt the pods |

Built with LangChain 1.x (`create_agent` + middleware) and **MCP servers** for every tool; the same servers plug into Claude Code or any MCP client. The terms are defined in [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md).

## What a triage looks like

Real output from `claude-sonnet-5-5` on tool outputs recorded from the kind demo, where a rollout dropped `DATABASE_URL`. It took 4 tool calls in about 11 s.

> ## The checkout pod checkout-7c856f898c-bjtfx (revision 2) is crash looping because it starts without the DATABASE_URL env var. Revision 1 had that variable and its pod is still healthy.
>
> **Root cause** (high confidence, `bad_rollout`): Deployment revision 2 (ReplicaSet checkout-7c856f898c) dropped the DATABASE_URL env var that revision 1 defined. The app exits with code 1 at startup because the variable is missing.
> **Severity:** medium  ·  **Affected:** demo/Deployment/checkout, demo/Pod/checkout-7c856f898c-bjtfx
>
> **Recommendations**
> 1. Roll back the checkout deployment to revision 1 (kubectl rollout undo deployment/checkout -n demo), or re-add DATABASE_URL to the pod template (from a Secret or ConfigMap).
> 2. Find out why the env var was removed in the latest change to the manifest or Helm values, and fix it at the source so it is not re-applied.
> 3. Add a CI check or startup validation so a rollout that lacks required config fails before it replaces healthy pods.
> 4. Don't restart the pod. A restart will not fix a missing env var.

The full Report, its evidence and the other Scenarios are in [docs/development.md](docs/development.md#what-a-triage-looks-like).

## Safety in brief

The controls that matter sit **outside the model**. The full table is in [docs/safety.md](docs/safety.md).

- **Read-only by default.** RBAC is a read-only ClusterRole bound per namespace, with no Secrets and no ConfigMaps.
- **Writes are opt-in and narrow.** Pod eviction and deployment scale only, per Contract. There is no `patch deployments`, so nothing can change an image or a command.
- **Every write waits for a human.** The Hub keeps its own list of reads and writes; a tool not on it is hidden.
- **Clients stay apart.** Every tool checks its cluster and namespace against its own Contract, on top of RBAC.
- **Secrets never reach the model.** Env var values, tokens and keys are redacted, and a Contract can mask its hostnames, names, emails and IPs.
- **Prompt injection is tested.** An eval plants an instruction in pod logs and fails if the agent even attempts a write.
- **The Actuator only resizes.** Requests only, never above the limit, nothing while the Kill switch is on, and its webhook fails open. A memory limit is raised only by a Reflex the Contract switches on, within its bound ([ADR 0005](docs/adr/0005-reflexes-may-raise-limits.md)).

## Quick start

Requirements: Python 3.12+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Docker, kind.

```bash
uv sync
make cluster demo          # kind cluster + three broken workloads in namespace "demo"
cp .env.example .env       # set SQUERO_MODEL_API_KEY; SQUERO_CONTRACTS_DIR=demo/contracts
export SOPS_AGE_KEY="$(cat demo/contracts/test-keys/*.agekey)"   # the demo's public test keys
uv run squero triage examples/alert-crashloop.json --contract demo-shop
```

The demo breaks three workloads in three classic ways:

| Workload | Failure | What the agent has to find |
|---|---|---|
| `checkout` | Revision 2 drops `DATABASE_URL`. The new pod crash loops while revision 1 keeps serving. | The crash in the logs, and that it started with the latest rollout |
| `reports` | Needs about 200 MB, limit is 48Mi | `OOMKilled`, exit 137, the limit vs. the workload |
| `frontend` | Image tag that doesn't exist | `ImagePullBackOff` and the bad tag |

To run it for real, start with [Running the Hub](docs/running-the-hub.md).
