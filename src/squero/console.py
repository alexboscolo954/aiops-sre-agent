"""The console's doors, shared by the console app (webapp.py) and the Hub MCP server.

Who: Tailscale's identity header. `tailscale serve` sets Tailscale-User-Login on
every request it proxies and strips any copy a client sends, so the header is only
as trustworthy as the port: the Hub listens on 127.0.0.1 behind `serve` (slice
0.5), but local processes and the other containers on the compose network could
still send it themselves. So the header alone opens only the token page: every
other page and call also needs the approver token, pasted once per browser and kept
as an HMAC of it in a Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict cookie. Every change must
come from the console's own pages (Sec-Fetch-Site or Origin): the identity header is
ambient, so a page elsewhere could otherwise make the browser send it.

The Jinja pages that were here are gone since slice 11.7b: their old addresses
redirect into the app.
