"""The Actuator (slice 12.1): applies the Hub's Approved Sizings inside a client's cluster.

It runs in that cluster with its own token, bound to one Contract's cluster, and RBAC that
can resize pods but never edit a workload (which could change its image). Every minute
it pulls its desired state from the Hub, resizes the pods of each new Approved Sizing's
workload in place (Kubernetes 1.33+), keeps what it did in one ConfigMap so a restart
applies nothing twice, writes an Event on the workload and reports each outcome (an
Actuation) to the Hub. The Hub decides and never pushes; a Kill switch reaches it as no
Sizings at all.

What it applied it holds (slice 12.2): its pod-creation webhook gives a new pod of that
Deployment the same requests (it fails open: with the Actuator down, pods start from their
template), until a person changes the template's requests, which hands the container back.

Before a resize (slice 12.3) it checks what would refuse or fight it: a pod's QoS class, a
VPA, an HPA on a resource's utilization, the namespace's LimitRange and ResourceQuota. Then
it resizes one canary pod, watches it 10 minutes, and the others one at a time, each until
the kubelet allocated it and the pod is Ready; an Infeasible resize, or one not done in 10
minutes, stops it there. Deployments, and from slice 12.8a StatefulSets and DaemonSets: a
DaemonSet's new pod gets only lowered requests from the webhook (it must fit any node), a
DaemonSet's pod whose node has no room is left as it runs while the others go on, and
neither kind's pod is ever evicted. From slice 12.8b Argo Rollouts, in place only: read as a
Deployment (`Apps`), their pods their own ReplicaSets', never evicted. From slice 12.8c
CronJobs, through the webhook only: held at once for their next run's pods, that first run
watched until it ends (`first_run`), a pod of it Failed or OOM-killed a Rollback.

Slice 12.9a (an audit's findings): a network failure is an ApiException (`Calm`), a minute
that fails keeps and reports what it did, a rollout waits out a passing failure, a put back
some pod refused is finished later (`finish`), restarts are counted from when a rollout
begins, and a refused approval leaves the earlier hold as it is. Slice 12.9b: the Kill
switch as last heard and the reports not yet taken are kept in its ConfigMap (`state.json`),
an approval a passing failure met is tried again, a rollout scaled to zero ends applied, a
CronJob's run is told by a recent minute in its Job's name, and an approval made again after
a Revert (`again`) applies the run that Revert undid. Slice 12.10: a pod whose node is gone
(`lost`) is never a Sizing's fault, nor given one's requests: no Rollback for its NotReady or
its run's Failed pod, and a rollout goes on without it. Slice 12.11: nor is a container its
node's own restart started again (`rebooted`).

Slice 13.1a: with the Contract's `reflexes.oom` it reports the OOM kills of the containers
the Hub lists, told as container-limit or node-level. Slice 13.1b (ADR 0005): it answers a
container-limit one with a Step-up, the container's memory limit and request raised
together on every pod in place (`step_up`). Slice 13.4: the Startup boost, a new pod's
CPU limit times its rule's factor from the webhook, back in place once the pod is Ready or
5 minutes old (`keep_boosts`). Those two are the only times it changes a limit.

Under Automation (slice 12.5) it also applies, unasked, the newest Sizing of each container
the Contract automates: a change under 10% ignored, an increase at once, a decrease at most
once a day. A workload a person annotated `squero-actuator/pause: "true"` is left alone,
as under the Kill switch. While the Hub is unreachable it changes nothing new, and says so
in an Event after 15 minutes.

A Revert (slice 12.6a), the Operator's undo, puts a container's pods back to its template's
requests in place, as a rollback does, and the Actuator stops holding it.

With the Contract's eviction on (slice 12.7), a pod whose resize its node can never fit (the
kubelet's Infeasible, or from Kubernetes 1.35 the API server's refusal) is evicted through
the Eviction API (PodDisruptionBudgets hold) inside one of the Contract's windows, one at a
time and at least 5 minutes apart; the webhook gives its
replacement the requests. Outside a window the rollout waits on it; a replacement not Ready
in 10 minutes is a rollback. A pod of a Deployment with one replica, or that no
PodDisruptionBudget covers, is never evicted: its rollout fails as with eviction off.
