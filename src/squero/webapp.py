"""The console app (slice 9.5a): a React single-page app at /app/ and its JSON API at
/api/v1/; since slice 11.7b the whole console (the Jinja pages are gone).

The console's doors (console.py): the page and its files need a
listed Operator's Tailscale identity; every API call also needs the approver cookie,
and answers 401 with the token page's address without it. The app is built in the
image's Docker build (console/, Vite) into SQUERO_APP_DIR; nothing loads from a CDN,
and its CSP allows nothing but the Hub's own origin. Since 11.5a it carries
model-written text (Reports, Answers, tool output) and alert titles from client
Alertmanagers, as fields: the app renders everything as text, never as markup, and
an Evidence link as text too, never a link.
