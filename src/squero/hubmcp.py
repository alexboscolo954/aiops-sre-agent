"""The Hub MCP server (slice 11.1a): the Operator's own MCP endpoint at /mcp/, for an MCP
client such as Claude Code on the Operator's devices.

Two doors, both required: the bearer SQUERO_MCP_TOKEN, and a listed Operator's Tailscale
identity, which `tailscale serve` adds to what it proxies (and strips from what a client
sends). The token alone could come from anything that read the Hub's env; the identity
header alone from anything else that reaches the port. Stateless HTTP: a Hub restart
(every contracts update) leaves no session for a client to lose.

Every tool takes one Contract and answers within it. What it returns reaches the
client's model, so it follows that Contract's Data policy as the Hub's own agent does:
secrets redacted, identifiers masked with the Contract's own key, error text included.
A placeholder in an argument becomes its value again only when this server handed it
out for that same Contract, the `contract` argument included (a client's id is likely
one of its own terms).

The Investigation agent never gets these tools: they live here, not in servers/.
