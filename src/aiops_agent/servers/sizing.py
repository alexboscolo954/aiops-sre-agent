"""Sizings MCP server: a Workload's stored Sizings for the agent (slice 9.6a).

Reads the Hub's latest stored run (as the console and the weekly digest do), never the
client's Prometheus. The server is built for one Contract and puts its id in every
query; the model passes a cluster, a namespace and a name, so another Contract's
Sizings are never reachable.

After an OOM kill a Sizing keeps memory as it is (the peak is the limit, not the
demand), so the tool adds a suggested memory request and limit for the Report.
