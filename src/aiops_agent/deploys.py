"""Deploy verification (slice 8.2): the deploys the Hub sees in a Contract's clusters,
each verified once by a Check after a delay.

The Hub polls the Contract's own kubernetes `recent_changes` (no model call). A change
is known by its identity (namespace, object, revision), never by its whole entry: its
age changes every poll, and an ArgoCD operation and its later history entry are one
deploy. Only identity reaches the Check's prompt: a change cause or sync message is
written by whoever deploys, so the agent reads those through its tools, as data.
