"""The Relay's connection (slice 3.1): MCP over a websocket the Relay dials, reversed.

A Relay runs inside a client's network and dials the Hub; over that one socket the
Relay is the MCP *server* (its cluster's tools) and the Hub the MCP *client*. mcp 2.3
has no websocket transport, so `bridge` turns any socket into the (read, write) stream
pair MCP runs over, framing each JSON-RPC message as one text frame exactly as its
stdio transport frames a line. The socket is two callables, so the Hub's Starlette
socket, the Relay's websockets connection and an in-memory pair all fit.

Everything a Relay sends is client-controlled data: the Hub keeps its own allowlist,
cluster and namespace checks, redaction and caps on it (ADR 0002).

Alerts (slice 3.4) ride the same socket beside MCP: the Relay takes its cluster's
Alertmanager webhook and sends each alert group as one JSON-RPC request (`ALERT`); the
Hub answers it once the alert is taken. The bridge hands those to `intercept`, so the
MCP session never sees them.
